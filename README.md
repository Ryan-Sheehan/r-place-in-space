## r/place in space

Author: Ryan Sheehan

This project is inspired by the combination of the Reddit internet experiment [r/place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnRCZK3KjUY) and Google Experiments Just a Line (With a little love for Zack Lieberman as well).

In the same way that each user was able to have authority over a single pixel when their timer reset, this project aims to give its users a real life plot for simple digital creations. Using [What3Words](https://what3words.com/), a service that has divided the world into a grid of 3m x 3m squares and assigned each one a unique 3 word address. By using these plots, we can assign them to a user, let them draw whatever they want in 3D space, and see to it that their creation is persistent by the use of our database that will store the coordinate information.
